# SteamMarketHelper (SMH)
Steam Marketplace Mobile Client for Android

## ❗ Note
Application in this branch has Steam Market actions. It can place and remove buy/sell orders.
But it seems, that Steam can count it as Market bots, which are against its ToS, so I'm not responsible for your account (in case of ban e.g.).
### Use it at your own risk!
